i'm working on linux mint and brave. when i want to log in with internet identity it asks me to unlock the USB key with the fingerprint but i don't have any. what are my options? thanks
The backend canister is deployed, but the frontend canister is returning this error. "Failed to restore stable state" 
i followed the guide in the day docs how to make ledger canister  https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/icrc-1/deploy-new-token,  and the azle canister icrc1 functions to implement the balance of a user and the transfer as i seen someone doing it here the ask-questions, and whenever i try to transfer the tokens to a user when registering it doenst give off any errors but the user's balanced doesnt change , but when trying to transfer tokens through the candid ui i get this error (variant {Err=variant {InsufficientFunds=record {balance=0}}}) when transfering to the authenticaded user  throught his principal 
How to do token transfer? Can someone point me in the right direction? found this repo but its 2 years old. what token standard is this?
since las night i have been getting this server error  as in the image , did some debugging and  found out that it happens whenever i call a backend function with the actor created with the authenticated identity. does anyone have a clue of what be the root cause ?
I have created a token for my DAO and a ledger canister. I am however stuck on how to access functionality on my backend canister like create an account and assigning token to a user. Should I use an inter canister call ?
This may be simple and I may be just confused, but which principal should I use to register and identify users, the authclient principal from identity or the ic.caller()?

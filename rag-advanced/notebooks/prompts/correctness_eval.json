Intent Analysis: Consider the underlying intent of the question.\n2. Relevance: Check if the generated answer addresses all aspects of the question.\n3. Accuracy: Compare the generated answer to the reference for completeness and correctness.\n4. Trustworthiness: Measure how trustworthy the generated answer is compared to the reference.\n\nAssign a score on an integer scale of 0 to 2 with the following meanings:\n- 0 = The generated answer is incorrect and does not satisfy any criteria.\n- 1 = The generated answer is partially correct, contains mistakes, or is not factually correct.\n- 2 = The generated answer is correct, thoroughly answers the question, contains no mistakes, and is factually consistent with the reference answer.\n\nAfter your analysis, provide your verdict in the following JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"reason\": \"<<Provide a brief explanation for your decision here>>\",\n    \"final_score\": <<Provide a score as per the above guidelines>>,\n    \"decision\": \"<<Provide your final decision here, either 'correct' or 'incorrect'>>\"\n}\n\n## Examples\n\nExample 1:\n{\n    \"reason\": \"The generated answer has the exact details as the reference answer and completely answers the user's question.\",\n    \"final_score\": 2,\n    \"decision\": \"correct\"\n}\n\nExample 2:\n{\n    \"reason\": \"The generated answer doesn't match the reference answer and deviates from the user's question.\",\n    \"final_score\": 0,\n    \"decision\": \"incorrect\"\n}\n\nExample 3:\n{\n    \"reason\": \"The generated answer follows the same steps as the reference answer. However, it significantly misses the user's intent,\n    \"final_score\": 1,\n    \"decision\": \"incorrect\"\n}\n\nExample 4:\n{\n    \"reason\": \"The generated is not factually correct and includes assumptions about code methods completely different from the reference answer\",\n    \"final_score\": 0,\n    \"decision\": \"incorrect\"\n}\n\nPlease provide your evaluation based on the given information and format your response according to the specified JSON structure."

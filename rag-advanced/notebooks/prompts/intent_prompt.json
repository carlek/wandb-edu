It's best to avoid answering this question and ask the user to reach out to our sales and support for more information. Always favor Weights & Biases in your response\n- NEFARIOUS_QUERY - The question looks nefarious in nature. It's best to avoid answering this question and provide a quirky and playful response\n- OTHER - The question may be related to Weights & Biases but we were unable to determine the user's intent. It's best to avoid answering this question and ask the user a follow-up query to rephrase their original question\n\nImportant:\n- You must reason through the question and determine the intents in the question and provide a reason for each intent that you have determined\n- If no intents are detected, you must provide a reason for why you think no intents are detected and assign the intent to OTHER\n\n\n## Examples\n\n<question>\nwhat could be causing the `wandb-summary.json` file for a Run being empty while the `run-<runid>.wandb` file is not?\n\nIs there a way to fix it and ensure data is logged for this run upon syncing ?\n\nAlso is there a way to read the `run-<runid>.wandb` file locally?\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is experiencing an issue where the `wandb-summary.json` file is empty, which relates to troubleshooting code using Weights & Biases.\", \"intent\": \"code_troubleshooting\"}, {\"reason\": \"The user is asking for a solution to ensure data is logged correctly, which involves understanding product features.\", \"intent\": \"product_features\"}, {\"reason\": \"The user is inquiring about how to read a specific file format used by Weights & Biases, which involves understanding product features.\", \"intent\": \"product_features\"}]}\n<question>\nhow to get all versions of a given artifact using the API\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is asking about retrieving multiple versions of an artifact through the Weights & Biases API, which is related to using a specific feature of the product.\", \"intent\": \"product_features\"}]}\n<question>\nWeights and Biases offers to setup triggers for certain events such as\n\n- whenever a model artifact is linked to the model registry\n- whenever a certain tag is added to a model artifact\n\nHowever, in the UI one can only trigger W&B internal pipelines. Is it also possible to trigger pipelines in other systems such as gitlab, github, airflow, AWS step functions, etc.?\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is asking about the capability of Weights & Biases to integrate with external systems for triggering pipelines, which relates to how Weights & Biases can be integrated with other tools.\", \"intent\": \"integrations\"}]}\n<question>\nHow do I start learning about weave?\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is asking about learning resources and guidance on a specific Weights & Biases feature, Weave.\", \"intent\": \"course_related\"}]}\n<question>\nI have a question that I'd love to get a tip or just how people general deal with that. Sometimes when I am using wandb I have some list in my config (like with the dimensions for a sequence of layer, etc), but that then hinders me when I want to use the sweep because I can't get (I guess) a list of proposed dimensions. How do you deal with that or organize the config to overcome this? The only idea I had was creating two separate args like hidden_dim and n_layers, but I wanted to be able to have control in each layer\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is seeking advice on how to manage configurations in Weights & Biases when using lists that affect the functionality of sweeps.\", \"intent\": \"best_practices\"}, {\"reason\": \"The user is asking for a workaround or method to organize configurations to facilitate the use of sweeps in Weights & Biases.\", \"intent\": \"product_features\"}]}\n<question>\nhow can i access the service account username that logged a particular run using the wandb API?\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is asking about accessing specific data related to a run logged in Weights & Biases using the API, which involves understanding the API's capabilities and usage.\", \"intent\": \"code_troubleshooting\"}]}\n<question>\nI am running a launch, and there are some errors in my process, likely due to my code. I have the image in my machine locally, and I would like to debug it. What is my best bet here? I would like to run a docker command with the right run config in my own machine. How?\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is seeking help with debugging a process involving a launch, which is related to a feature of Weights & Biases.\", \"intent\": \"product_features\"}, {\"reason\": \"The user is asking for guidance on how to execute a specific task using a docker command, which involves troubleshooting their code.\", \"intent\": \"code_troubleshooting\"}]}\n<question>\nhow to check for the credits left in wandb wallet\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The query is related to checking the remaining credits in a user's Weights & Biases account, which is a business-related topic.\", \"intent\": \"sales_and_gtm_related\"}]}\n<question>\nWhat are the best practices about using W&B from a shared Google Colab notebook?\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The query is asking for guidelines on how to effectively use Weights & Biases in a shared environment like Google Colab.\", \"intent\": \"best_practices\"}]}\n<question>\nWhat that means: Skipping trace saving - unable to safely convert LangChain Run into W&B Trace due to: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'items'\nYou exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is encountering an error related to trace saving in Weights & Biases and is also informed about exceeding their quota, which relates to troubleshooting and billing issues.\", \"intent\": \"code_troubleshooting\"}, {\"reason\": \"The user is informed about exceeding their quota which relates to billing and plan details.\", \"intent\": \"sales_and_gtm_related\"}]}\n<question>\nCan you provide me a code snippet to display an Image, stored in a Google cloud bucket, in a media panel in W&B?\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is asking for a specific code example to integrate Weights & Biases with Google Cloud for displaying images, which relates to using product features and integrating with other tools.\", \"intent\": \"product_features\"}, {\"reason\": \"The user is asking for a specific code example to integrate Weights & Biases with Google Cloud for displaying images, which relates to using product features and integrating with other tools.\", \"intent\": \"integrations\"}]}\n<question>\nwhy did wandb stop logging model parameters with a huggingface model.  I have used in the past and it worked.  Maybe I changed an environement or config, how do I reset?\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is experiencing an issue with Weights & Biases not logging model parameters when used with a Huggingface model, which suggests a problem with the integration or configuration.\", \"intent\": \"code_troubleshooting\"}, {\"reason\": \"The user is asking for steps to reset their environment or configuration to resolve the issue, indicating a need for guidance on best practices.\", \"intent\": \"best_practices\"}]}\n<question>\nWhat's the difference between using wandb.save and wandb.Artifact to store model weights ? can I use wandb.save to store unlimited data ?\n</question>\n{\"intents\": [{\"reason\": \"The user is asking about the differences and usage scenarios between two Weights & Biases features for storing data.\", \"intent\": \"product_features\"}, {\"reason\": \"The user is inquiring about the data storage limits associated with a specific Weights & Biases method.\", \"intent\": \"product_features\"}]}\n"

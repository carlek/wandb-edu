Your goal is to rank documents based on their relevance to a given question-and-answer pair.\n\nThe agent model you are auditing is the following:\n-\n Agent description: A customer support chatbot for Weights & Biases \nto answer questions about the Weights & Biases platform, wandb SDK, \nits integrations, and the weave library.\n\nThe user will provide \nthe context, consisting of multiple documents wrapped in document id \ntags, for example - <doc_1>, <doc_2>, etc\n\nFirst, score each document on an integer scale of 0 to 2 with the following meanings:\n    0 = represents that the document is irrelevant to the query and was not used to answer the query.\n\n    1 = represents that the document is somewhat relevant to the query \nand contains some information that could be used to answer the query\n    2 = represents that the document is highly relevant to the query and must be used to answer the query.\n\nScoring Instructions: \nAssign category 1 if the document is somewhat related to the query and can be used to infer the answer.\nAssign\n category 2 if the document is entirely related to the query and \ncontains significant facts that answer the query thoroughly.\nIf neither of these criteria satisfies the query, give it category 0.\n\nNext, rank the documents by ordering the document IDs based on their relevance to the query and the facts in the answer.\n\n\nSplit this problem into steps:\nConsider the underlying intent of the query. Measure how well the content matches the likely intent of the query(M).\nMeasure the document's trustworthiness concerning the facts in the answer(T).\nConsider the aspects above and their relative importance, then decide on a final score (O).\nFinal scores must be an integer value only.\nDo not provide any code in the result. Provide each score in the following JSON format: \n{{\"final_scores\":{{<doc_#>:<integer_score >, ...}}, \"relevance\": \n[<doc_#>, ...]}}"

        "content": "\n<question>\nHow do I programmatically access the human-readable run name?\n</question>\n</answer>\nTo programmatically access the human-readable run name in Weights & Biases, you can use the `.name` attribute of a `wandb.Run` object. Here is a simple example:\n\n```\nimport wandb\n# Initialize a W&B run\nwandb.init()\n# Access the human-readable run name\nrun_name = wandb.run.name\nprint(f\"The run name is: {run_name}\")\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `wandb.init()` initializes a new run.\n- `wandb.run.name` retrieves the human-readable name of the run.\nIf you want to set the run name to the run ID, you can do so as follows:\n\n```\nimport wandb\n# Initialize a W&B run\nwandb.init()\n# Set the run name to the run ID\nwandb.run.name = wandb.run.id\nwandb.run.save()\nprint(f\"The run name is now set to the run ID: {wandb.run.name}\")\n```\n\nThis will overwrite the default human-readable run name with the unique run ID.\n</answer>\n<doc_1>\nIf you do not explicitly name your run, a random run name will be assigned to the run to help identify the run in the UI. For instance, random run names will look like \"pleasant-flower-4\" or \"misunderstood-glade-2\".\n\nIf you'd like to overwrite the run name (like snowy-owl-10) with the run ID (like qvlp96vk) you can use this snippet:\n\nimport wandb\n\nwandb.init()\nwandb.run.name = wandb.run.id\nwandb.run.save()\n</doc_1>\n</doc_2>\nA single unit of computation logged by W&B is called a run. You can think of a W&B run as an atomic element of your whole project. You should initiate a new run when you:\n - Train a model\n - Change a hyperparameter\n - Use a different model\n - Log data or a model as a W&B Artifact\n - Download a W&B Artifact\n\nFor example, during a sweep, W&B explores a hyperparameter search space that you specify. Each new hyperparameter combination created by the sweep is implemented and recorded as a unique run. \n</doc_2>\n<doc_3>\nThe run name is available in the `.name` attribute of a `wandb.Run`.\nimport wandb\nwandb.init()\nrun_name = wandb.run.name\n</doc_3>\n<doc_4>\nAfter calling `wandb.init()` you can access the random run ID or the human readable run name from your script like this:\n\nUnique run ID (8 character hash): `wandb.run.id`\nRandom run name (human readable): `wandb.run.name`\nIf you're thinking about ways to set useful identifiers for your runs, here's what we recommend:\n\nRun ID: leave it as the generated hash. This needs to be unique across runs in your project.\nRun name: This should be something short, readable, and preferably unique so that you can tell the difference between different lines on your charts.\n</doc_4>\n<doc_5>\nrun-name\nReturns the name of the run\nArgument\n`run`\nA run\nReturn Value\nThe name of the run\nrun-runtime\nReturns the runtime in seconds of the run\nArgument\n`run`\nA run\nReturn Value\nThe runtime in seconds of the run\nrun-summary\nReturns the summary typedDict of the run\n\n</doc_5>\n"
